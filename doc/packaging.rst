Packaging
=========

Phase 1 - no boxes
------------------
At the very beginning, a bare chip was inserted into plastic box and fixed to cargo using silver dug tape. There were no peripherals except one Dallas sensor.

Phase 2 - PLA box
-----------------
Chip is boxed in box printed on 3D printer from PLA plastic. LCD display was added showing various run time information (e.g. wifi connection status, temperatures from all sensors) Refer to `boxes` directory for FreeCAD sources of all boxes.
